# GrubDash Project

## Practiced/Reinforced the following:

- Running tests from the command line

- Using common middleware packages

- Receiving requests through routes

- Accessing relevant information through route parameters

- Building an API following RESTful design principles

- Writing custom middleware functions

### Frontend

https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end

8/20/23: My plan is to come back and connect the front end. For now this works on local machine by forking/cloning front end and setting url env variable to the base url for the API.
